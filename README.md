# osmhasanain-landpage
This project is web page develop with flutter framework , it as CV for Osama developer and contain projects, posts , advices and contact with me if anyone would like work with me.

# This notes if you would like use this template :
1- The personal image which apeared in left ot right side, here I used four two on top of each other with opacity for everyone, so you need put two images, the first is vibrant image and the another is faded image, until work animation with mouse cursor and when init page loading.
in lib/shared/resources/assets_managers.dart from line 38 to 45 you will see four variables from assets, this because we use arabic and english, so two vibrant images and two faded images

2- The job title, short desription, skills, positions and work gallery this all you can edit its manually in coding from lib/shared/resources/home_data.dart

3- The blogs this I connect the project with firebse and create project in firebase , so you must create project in firebase and reconnection with project.
